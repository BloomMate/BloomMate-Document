\section{Introduction}
\subsection{motivation}
a. Customer Trend Analysis
\begin{enumerate}
    \item positive effect of pet plant
    \item[] Pet plant is known for positive effect to give psychological/emotional stability and inspiration about life satisfaction. Especially, it is showing clear tangible results in several areas like overcome stress and depression, therapy various physical illnesses, air purification.\cite{ju2020}\\
    
    \item The appearance of Green Hobby
    \item[] As interest in planterior increases, sales of flower gardens/flowers increased compared to the previous year (2019). The search volume of 'planterior' on Naver, a search portal site, also increased significantly during the pandemic compared to pre-COVID-19, especially during the April 2020 pandemic. Also, attention in urban farmer, self-gardening, weekend farm is growth. An indicator that can confirm this is the number of Instagram hashtag posts, with the home gardening tag exceeding 520,000 and the planterior tag exceeding 163,000. \cite{hanaif_report} \\
    
    \item Impact of COVID-19
    \item[] Pet plant has long received attention to relieve loneliness in single-person households or the elderly, and the home gardening market, including pet plant, has grown rapidly as restrictions have arisen on outdoor activities since the COVID-19.
Compared to before COVID-19, sales of flowerpots increased by 20\%, gardening supplies increased by 48\%, and seedlings increased by 92\%. March to April 2020, SSG.com saw a 97\% increase in home gardening category sales, and Enuri.com saw a 491\% increase in garden set sales.
Accordingly, the Rural Development Administration predicted that domestic home gardening sales will increase rapidly after COVID-19, reaching 500 billion won in 2023, an eight-fold increase from 60 billion won in 2020. \cite{ajunews_article} \\

\item Expanding the market size of plant cultivation machines
\item[] The market for plant growers that allow you to grow flowers and vegetables at home becomes larger. The market size, which was 10 billion won in 2019, increased to 60 billion won in 2020 and is expected to reach 500 billion won in 2023. \cite{spcmagazine_article}
\\

\item Urban agriculture
\item[] The number of 'urban farmers' in Seoul, who farm on rooftops, verandas, and weekend farms, increased 14-fold from 45,000 in 2011 to 640,000 in 2019. During the same period, Seoul's urban agricultural space also increased 6.9 times from 29ha to 202ha. \cite{hani_article} \\

\item Desired residential space after retirement
\item[] In 2021, the real estate platform 'Zigbang' conducted a survey on the residential space desired after retirement, and 'country house, townhouse' ranked first with 38\%, beating apartments (35.4\%). When comparing housing transactions in the first half of the year by housing type, apartment transactions decreased in June compared to January, while house transactions increased.  \cite{donga_article}\\

\item[]Considering these data, interest in horticulture such as home gardening and planterior is steadily increasing, and along with this, interest in weekend farms, vacation homes, country houses, etc. is also steadily growth. Therefore, it can be expected that the demand for gardening or growing plants in country houses will gradually get larger. At the same time, sales of plant-related home appliances will also become greater. \\
\end{enumerate}


%Company Analysis

\indent b. Company Analysis
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Regulations related to the companion plant industry
    \item[] As interest in pet plants grew, the Seoul Metropolitan Council passed the ‘Ordinance on Fostering and Supporting the Pet Plant Industry’ at the plenary session in May, laying the foundation for the growth of the pet plant industry and focusing on expanding supporting projects.\cite{mediapen_article} \\
    
    \item LG Electronics: Innovation for a Better Life 
    \item[] LG Electronics is currently trying to change from being a company that only sells simple home appliances to a company that provides a lifestyle that can change customers' lives to be smarter through applications such as ThinQ.

\end{figure}
\\
Customers are always at the center of the LG brand story. LG makes an incredible contribution to the lives of its customers and always strives to make their lives more valuable.\\
\\
\indent i. PEOPLE\\
Just as important as a good product is the customer experience using that product. Customers' lives are improved with new products through creativity and innovation, and a richer life is completed by experiencing products with excellent aesthetic satisfaction. Every product we create must be able to play that role in our customers’ lives. Creating a better life is how we do our best for our customers.\\

ii. SINCERITY \\
How to make life new and more convenient, our technology always starts with sincerity toward customers and their lives. It is an attitude of constantly making passionate efforts and pursuing sophistication through thorough perfection rather than flashiness, and the most important factor when creating products is sincerity.\\

iii. BASICS \\
Rather than being different for the sake of being different or flashy for show, we focus on the core values that customers who use the product expect. The core value refers to offering important value to customers' lives beyond the product's functions. \cite{lge_document}
\\
\end{enumerate}

\indent c. Product Analysis
\begin{enumerate}
\item LG Smart Cottage
\item[] It is a small modular house in the form of a second house that combines LG Electronics' advanced energy, heating, and cooling technology, and differentiated premium home appliances, with a two-story one-room structure measuring 31.4m$^2$.
The 4kW solar panel installed on the roof can cover a significant amount of the electricity used per day by two adults, and the heat pump cooling and heating system 'Therma V Monobloc' is installed to significantly reduce energy consumption. A home energy solution was implemented that stores used power in a home ESS system. There is a charger for electric vehicles (EV) outside the Smart Cottage, and the inside is equipped with premium home appliances equipped with various technologies to increase energy efficiency, such as the Objet Collection Wash Tower Compact, a dishwasher, an induction electric range, and a water purifier. Through the ‘LG ThinQ’ application, you can check home appliances, heating, cooling, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and energy storage and consumption. It has a premium interior with a warm atmosphere, with a sophisticated design based on the concept of walnut wood tone and an exterior finished in light beige. \\

\label{fig:tiiun}
\caption{LG Tiiun} 
\end{figure}
\item[] LG Tiiun is a home plant grower designed to target the home gardening market, which is expanding due to the impact of COVID-19. It can be said to be the culmination of LG's technologies, combining the temperature control technology of the Dios refrigerator, the air conditioning technology of the Whisen air conditioner, the inverter compressor technology of the Tromm dryer, the water supply control technology of the PuriCare water purifier, and the LED lights of LG Display. You can easily and comfortably grow plants by filling them with water 6 times and adding nutrients 6 times in a month. The power consumption for one year is 42.5kWh, which is similar to that of a small refrigerator. LG Tiiun consists of two shelves (upper and lower compartments), and a total of six seed kits can be installed, three each. Seed kits limited to 2 types of herbs, 4 types of leafy vegetables, and 1 type of flower are being sold. Through the LG ThinQ app, you can check the operation/growing status on your smartphone and receive a notification when nutrients or water are insufficient. \\

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.]LG Smart Cottage: absence of home turf
    \item[] People live in house almost enjoy gardening. However, LG Smart Cottage that LG Electronics launched doesn’t have home turf. So, we think LG Tiiun for outside to help with LG’s brand goal is necessary. Especially in the case of smart cottages, many people buy them as a second home and are unlikely to be there every day. In this case, they may struggle to get information about the condition of the plants, unless they have restrictions except for gardening with Tiiun.\\
    \item[b.]Brown Thumb
    \item[] In abroad, the term, brown thumb, means the people who always kill the plant because of lack of skills. Like this, there are more things to worry about in growing plants than you think, so if you don't pay attention, you often kill the plants, and even if you care a lot, there are many cases where you kill the plants because you don't know how to grow them properly. Therefore, Software, to help all of the plant growers can grow them easily, is essential. \\
    \item[c.]Rasing Plants: absence of communication
    \item[] Although raising pet plants is already known to help with various emotional stability, it was judged that there was less of a feeling of communication with each other compared to animals with which one could actually communicate. In order to grow plants well, constant attention is needed, and for this to happen, it is important to have affection for the plants. Therefore, in order to increase the fun of growing plants, it is necessary to be able to communicate with plants. \\
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.]Meeting the needs of more customers
    \item[]Considering the aforementioned, the number of people interested in gardening, cottages, etc. will increase. To contribute to increasing the value of life for the growing number of caterers' customers who grow their own gardens in cottages, we have adopted LG Tiiun which can be used in the outside garden of LG Smart Cottage as a target appliance. \\
    \item[b.]Brown thumb turns into green thumb with LG
    \item[]We have designed a software that allows people who are not talented in plant care to easily grow plants. To briefly introduce the features, customers can register their plants with the app and it will adjust the appropriate temperature, humidity, light, ventilation, etc. according to the plant species and automatically spray water and nutrients. Through the camera, the current health status of the plant (pest infestation, wilting, etc.) can be identified using AI, so that the customer can come and check the plant before it dies. \\
    \item[c.]Build a bond with plants
    \item[]One of the disadvantages of growing plants is that customer can only get an idea of their condition by looking at the wilting of their leaves or the appearance of fruits or flowers, and can't communicate with them directly like animals. These disadvantages reduce the fun of growing plants. To overcome this, we devised a feature that allows customer to communicate with plants using generative AI. If customers can communicate with their plants, they will be able to build a bond with them and give them more affection. \\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Research on Any Relative Software}

Known for its sleek and intuitive user interface, MacOS offers a seamless development experience. It provides a wide range of powerful tools and frameworks, making it an excellent choice for building applications for various platforms. With MacOS, developers can take advantage of tools like Xcode, which is the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for Apple's platforms. This is especially important when the application we want to develop must also support IOS. To develop for iOS, Xcode is essential, and Xcode can only run on MacOS. Xcode offers a comprehensive set of tools and resources for developing iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications. Additionally, MacOS has a strong integration with other Apple products and services, allowing developers to create a cohesive ecosystem across different devices. Overall, MacOS provides a robust and efficient development environment for developers looking to create software for Apple. \\
    \end{enumerate}

    \item[b.]Tools and Language

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[1.]JavaScript(JS)
        \item[]JavaScript is a widely-used programming language known for its versatility and its ability to create dynamic and interactive web applications. It serves as the backbone of modern web development and is supported by all major web browsers. With JavaScript, developers can add functionality to websites, handle user interactions, and manipulate web page content. It is a high-level, interpreted language that allows for rapid development and prototyping. After the introduction of Google's V8 engine-based Node.js, JavaScript can now be executed in a non-browser environment as well. JavaScript also benefits from a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, which enhance its capabilities and simplify the development process. These libraries and frameworks are published by npm, the Node Package Manager, and developers can easily download and utilize them in their projects. Some notable features of JavaScript include its single-threaded nature, prototype-based language structure, and its status as a script language. JavaScript is regularly updated by ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association), with the updated version being referred to as ECMAScript. Recent ECMAScript versions support object-oriented programming and functional programming. In summary, JavaScript is an essential language for web development, empowering developers to create engaging and interactive user experiences on the web. \\

        \item[2.]TypeScript(TS) \cite{typescript}
        \item[]TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides static typing, making it a powerful tool for building robust and scalable applications. It was developed by Microsoft and first published to the public in 2012. With TypeScript, developers can catch errors during compile-time, resulting in fewer bugs and improved code quality. It offers advanced features such as interfaces, generics, and decorators, which enhance code organization and maintainability. TypeScript is fully compatible with JavaScript, allowing developers to gradually migrate their existing JavaScript codebases to TypeScript. It also seamlessly integrates with popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks, making it a versatile choice for web development. Nowadays, companies are compelled to adopt TypeScript instead of JavaScript, regardless of project size, due to its numerous benefits. Overall, TypeScript is a valuable addition to the development environment, offering enhanced type safety and productivity for developers.\\

        \item[3.]yarn \cite{yarn2016}
        \item[]Yarn is a JavaScript package manager that helps manage project package dependencies and facilitates package sharing among developers. Due to security and performance issues experienced with npm as their projects grew larger, Facebook developed Yarn as a replacement. Yarn offers improvements in performance and security compared to npm. One key advantage of Yarn is that it installs packages in parallel, unlike npm which installs them sequentially, resulting in faster installation times. Yarn also utilizes caching, further speeding up package installation. Additionally, Yarn utilizes semantic versioning to specify package versions. For this project, we have chosen to use Yarn due to its fast performance. This is especially important as we will be installing various frameworks and libraries for frontend development. \\

        \item[4.]Eslint/Prettier \cite{eslintprettier}
        \item[]ESLint performs automated scans of your JavaScript and TypeScript files to detect common syntax and style errors. Prettier scans your files for style issues and automatically reformats your code to ensure consistent rules for indentation, spacing, semicolons, and quotes (single vs double). We use these tools on our teams for the following reasons: \\
        \begin{itemize}
            \item They promote consistency by enforcing the same rules for everyone.\\
            \item They save time in code reviews by allowing us to focus on code structure and semantics instead of style issues.\\
            \item They catch errors, with ESLint being particularly effective at detecting syntax errors and basic type errors like undefined variables. Although Prettier doesn't catch errors, it still contributes to code quality.\\
            \item Changes made by these tools are automatically applied to code when the file is saved in Visual Studio Code.\\
        \end{itemize}
        While setting up these tools requires an initial time investment, the time-saving benefits accumulate over time.\\

        \item[5.]React-Native \cite{reactnative}
        \item[]React Native is an open-source UI software framework developed by Meta Platform, Inc. It enables developers to use the React framework along with native platform capabilities to build applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, and Windows. Unlike web apps, React Native communicates with the Native Thread through native bridges, resulting in optimized performance. In terms of hybrid frameworks, Flutter has an advantage in making it easier for web developers to write React Native code. Previously, there was a perception that Flutter was much faster and lighter. However, with the introduction of Fabric in React Native 0.68, which supports faster communication between Android and iOS, that perception has become a thing of the past. That being said, React Native does heavily rely on other libraries, even for core features like the camera function in mobile applications, which requires the use of third-party libraries. Nevertheless, due to the aforementioned advantages, it is difficult to find a better option than React Native for creating fast and cross-platform applications that support both Android and iOS.\\

        \item[6.]React Query \cite{tanstackquery}
        \item[]React Query is a library that simplifies the process of fetching, caching, and keeping your React application's server state synchronized and updated. Unlike other data fetching methods that require complex and verbose code, React Query provides a simple and intuitive API that can be used within React Components. Previously, managing state in React applications lacked clear distinction, leading to confusion when writing code. Specifically, determining which state should be continuously fetched from the network and which state is solely dependent on the client required a thorough understanding. However, with the introduction of React Query, you can easily differentiate between server state management and client state management in your React application. This distinction enables efficient collaboration and simplifies cache operations, loading operations, and the implementation of difficult asynchronous operations in network state management. \\

        \item[7.]Recoil \cite{recoiljs}
        \item[]In React, it can be challenging to directly pass data between two different components unless they have a parent-child relationship. In such cases, you need to send the data to the parent component and then pass it back to the component that requires it. This process, known as props drilling, can make it difficult to keep track of the props being passed around. That's why having a global state management library is crucial for modern React applications. React's own Context API requires implementing it from scratch and requires significant effort to prevent unnecessary re-rendering. On the other hand, Redux, which was the most popular choice until 2020, has a steep learning curve and a complex architecture that can make it challenging to understand the code flow quickly. In contrast, Recoil is relatively easy to use if you understand the basic syntax of React. It is also free from re-rendering issues and provides various optional features for global state management. Additionally, Recoil is lightweight and does not significantly impact application performance.\\

        \item[8.]Python \cite{gabialibrary}
        \item[]Developed in 1991 by programmer Guido van Rossum, Python is known for its readability and easy syntax, making it quicker to learn compared to other programming languages. As a result, it has gained popularity among non-programmers and is utilized in various fields such as statistics, data analysis, modeling, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. Python's intuitive and user-friendly syntax makes it highly recommended for beginners in programming. Additionally, it is the most widely adopted language, meaning that many libraries necessary for application development are readily available. Therefore, we have chosen Python for building the backend and training machine learning models.\\

        \item[]Since SQLite doesn't run as a server process, it's a ready-to-use database. It's lightweight but has all the necessary features. It supports transactions and is platform-agnostic. Since it's a locally run DB, it's also highly portable. However, it is not an isolated environment, so the server must also handle the burden of the DB. Additionally, you can't authorize users, only assign basic access rights based on the operating system. We decided to use SQLite because it is supported by Django and our application doesn't have a complex database structure or require various features of a database management system.\\

        \item[11.]AWS EC2 \cite{aws-ec2-docs}
        \item[]Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers scalable computing capacity on-demand in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. By using Amazon EC2, you can accelerate application development and deployment while reducing hardware costs. Instead of purchasing physical servers, our team has decided to utilize a cloud system for its economic benefits and flexibility for future expansion. With Amazon EC2, you can deploy multiple virtual servers, configure security and networking, and manage storage. It allows you to increase capacity (scale up) to handle compute-intensive tasks such as monthly or annual processes or spikes in website traffic. Conversely, when usage decreases, you can decrease capacity (scale down). One of the great advantages of Amazon EC2 is that it is free for the first year. Since our application needs to be built urgently and will not run for more than a year, Amazon EC2 is an excellent choice.\\

        \item[12.]Jupyter NoteBook \cite{wikidocs-tutorial}
        \item[]Jupyter Notebook is a popular open-source web application that provides an interactive environment for writing code, visualizing data, and documenting.

These frameworks simplify tasks such as data acquisition, model training, making predictions, and refining results. Additionally, TensorFlow Lite is a mobile library designed for deploying models on mobile devices, microcontrollers, and other edge devices. When running a machine learning or deep learning model through TensorFlow Lite, it produces a small file of less than 3MB. This allows us to use trained models on mobile without any capacity constraints. In our application, we will use TensorFlow Lite to ensure immediate model availability on mobile devices.\\

        \item[14.]Yolo V8 \cite{datahunt-yolo-object-detection}
        \item[]Object detection is a technique used in the field of image processing and computer vision. It encompasses various techniques such as multi-labeled and key point, which have emerged due to recent advancements in computer vision. The YOLO model is the most representative model among object detection techniques. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system. It is renowned for its faster and more accurate data processing compared to traditional models. YOLO adopts a deep learning-based approach for object detection and recognition. Its efficiency lies in its avoidance of complex pipelines, which makes it particularly suitable for real-time decision-making tasks. In simple terms, YOLO divides the input image into regular segments called grids. It then passes these segments through a neural network to generate bounding boxes and class predictions, ultimately determining the final detection output. Multiple instances are trained on the entire dataset before testing on real images and videos. As of March 23, 2023, this is the most recent version of YOLO, developed by Ultralytics in January 2023. A new repository for YOLO models has been released, serving as a unified framework for training object detection, instance segmentation, and image classification models. \\

        \item[15.]Material Design \cite{google-material-design}
        \item[]UI/UX is crucial in modern mobile and web applications, and a unified UI can greatly enhance the user experience. This unified UI is achieved through the use of a design system. However, implementing a design system on your own can be challenging. Therefore, it is common practice to utilize publicly available design systems, with Google's Material Design being the most prominent one. Material Design is a design approach that combines the benefits of flat design with the use of shadows to create a sense of depth. It also provides a comprehensive design system that includes typography and primary-secondary color schemes. This design can be easily implemented in the Figma library and seamlessly integrated into code using react-native-paper. \\

        \item[16.]Git \cite{velog-git}
        \item[]Git is an effective version control system that allows you to manage versions and incorporate changes and updates seamlessly. But before delving into Git, let`s first discuss what a ``version control system'' is. It is a system that records changes to a file over time and enables you to retrieve that file later when needed. When working on a document, there are usually multiple revisions and updates from the initial draft to the final version. Along the way, we often rename the file to ``final,'' ``\_final,'' ``finalized,'' and so on, thus overwriting the previous versions. This can make it difficult to go back to a specific point in time and understand the changes that were made. However, with a version control system, this becomes possible. By using a version control system, you can manage multiple versions of the same information. This allows you to track changes over time and identify the individuals who made them. You can easily revert back to previous versions or the original version, and quickly identify the person responsible for any issues that may arise.\\
