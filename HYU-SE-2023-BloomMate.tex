\section{Introduction}
\subsection{motivation}
a. Customer Trend Analysis
\begin{enumerate}
    \item positive effect of pet plant
    \item[] Pet plant is known for positive effect to give psychological/emotional stability and inspiration about life satisfaction. Especially, it is showing clear tangible results in several areas like overcome stress and depression, therapy various physical illnesses, air purification.\cite{ju2020}\\
    
    \item The appearance of Green Hobby
    \item[] As interest in planterior increases, sales of flower gardens/flowers increased compared to the previous year (2019). The search volume of 'planterior' on Naver, a search portal site, also increased significantly during the pandemic compared to pre-COVID-19, especially during the April 2020 pandemic. Also, attention in urban farmer, self-gardening, weekend farm is growth. An indicator that can confirm this is the number of Instagram hashtag posts, with the home gardening tag exceeding 520,000 and the planterior tag exceeding 163,000. \cite{hanaif_report} \\
    
    \item Impact of COVID-19
    \item[] Pet plant has long received attention to relieve loneliness in single-person households or the elderly, and the home gardening market, including pet plant, has grown rapidly as restrictions have arisen on outdoor activities since the COVID-19.
Compared to before COVID-19, sales of flowerpots increased by 20\%, gardening supplies increased by 48\%, and seedlings increased by 92\%. March to April 2020, SSG.com saw a 97\% increase in home gardening category sales, and Enuri.com saw a 491\% increase in garden set sales.
Accordingly, the Rural Development Administration predicted that domestic home gardening sales will increase rapidly after COVID-19, reaching 500 billion won in 2023, an eight-fold increase from 60 billion won in 2020. \cite{ajunews_article} \\

\item Expanding the market size of plant cultivation machines
\item[] The market for plant growers that allow you to grow flowers and vegetables at home becomes larger. The market size, which was 10 billion won in 2019, increased to 60 billion won in 2020 and is expected to reach 500 billion won in 2023. \cite{spcmagazine_article}
\\

\item Urban agriculture
\item[] The number of 'urban farmers' in Seoul, who farm on rooftops, verandas, and weekend farms, increased 14-fold from 45,000 in 2011 to 640,000 in 2019. During the same period, Seoul's urban agricultural space also increased 6.9 times from 29ha to 202ha. \cite{hani_article} \\

\item Desired residential space after retirement
\item[] In 2021, the real estate platform 'Zigbang' conducted a survey on the residential space desired after retirement, and 'country house, townhouse' ranked first with 38\%, beating apartments (35.4\%). When comparing housing transactions in the first half of the year by housing type, apartment transactions decreased in June compared to January, while house transactions increased.  \cite{donga_article}\\

\item[]Considering these data, interest in horticulture such as home gardening and planterior is steadily increasing, and along with this, interest in weekend farms, vacation homes, country houses, etc. is also steadily growth. Therefore, it can be expected that the demand for gardening or growing plants in country houses will gradually get larger. At the same time, sales of plant-related home appliances will also become greater. \\
\end{enumerate}


%Company Analysis

\indent b. Company Analysis
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Regulations related to the companion plant industry
    \item[] As interest in pet plants grew, the Seoul Metropolitan Council passed the ‘Ordinance on Fostering and Supporting the Pet Plant Industry’ at the plenary session in May, laying the foundation for the growth of the pet plant industry and focusing on expanding supporting projects.\cite{mediapen_article} \\
    
    \item LG Electronics: Innovation for a Better Life 
    \item[] LG Electronics is currently trying to change from being a company that only sells simple home appliances to a company that provides a lifestyle that can change customers' lives to be smarter through applications such as ThinQ.

\\
Customers are always at the center of the LG brand story. LG makes an incredible contribution to the lives of its customers and always strives to make their lives more valuable.\\
\\
\indent i. PEOPLE\\
Just as important as a good product is the customer experience using that product. Customers' lives are improved with new products through creativity and innovation, and a richer life is completed by experiencing products with excellent aesthetic satisfaction. Every product we create must be able to play that role in our customers’ lives. Creating a better life is how we do our best for our customers.\\

ii. SINCERITY \\
How to make life new and more convenient, our technology always starts with sincerity toward customers and their lives. It is an attitude of constantly making passionate efforts and pursuing sophistication through thorough perfection rather than flashiness, and the most important factor when creating products is sincerity.\\

iii. BASICS \\
Rather than being different for the sake of being different or flashy for show, we focus on the core values that customers who use the product expect. The core value refers to offering important value to customers' lives beyond the product's functions. \cite{lge_document}

\end{enumerate}

\indent c. Product Analysis
\begin{enumerate}
\item LG Smart Cottage
\item[] It is a small modular house in the form of a second house that combines LG Electronics' advanced energy, heating, and cooling technology, and differentiated premium home appliances, with a two-story one-room structure measuring 31.4m$^2$.
The 4kW solar panel installed on the roof can cover a significant amount of the electricity used per day by two adults, and the heat pump cooling and heating system 'Therma V Monobloc' is installed to significantly reduce energy consumption. A home energy solution was implemented that stores used power in a home ESS system. There is a charger for electric vehicles (EV) outside the Smart Cottage, and the inside is equipped with premium home appliances equipped with various technologies to increase energy efficiency, such as the Objet Collection Wash Tower Compact, a dishwasher, an induction electric range, and a water purifier. Through the ‘LG ThinQ’ application, you can check home appliances, heating, cooling, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and energy storage and consumption. It has a premium interior with a warm atmosphere, with a sophisticated design based on the concept of walnut wood tone and an exterior finished in light beige. \\

\end{figure}
\item[] LG Tiiun is a home plant grower designed to target the home gardening market, which is expanding due to the impact of COVID-19. It can be said to be the culmination of LG's technologies, combining the temperature control technology of the Dios refrigerator, the air conditioning technology of the Whisen air conditioner, the inverter compressor technology of the Tromm dryer, the water supply control technology of the PuriCare water purifier, and the LED lights of LG Display. You can easily and comfortably grow plants by filling them with water 6 times and adding nutrients 6 times in a month. The power consumption for one year is 42.5kWh, which is similar to that of a small refrigerator. LG Tiiun consists of two shelves (upper and lower compartments), and a total of six seed kits can be installed, three each. Seed kits limited to 2 types of herbs, 4 types of leafy vegetables, and 1 type of flower are being sold. Through the LG ThinQ app, you can check the operation/growing status on your smartphone and receive a notification when nutrients or water are insufficient. \\

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.]LG Smart Cottage: absence of home turf
    \item[] People live in house almost enjoy gardening. However, LG Smart Cottage that LG Electronics launched doesn’t have home turf. So, we think LG Tiiun for outside to help with LG’s brand goal is necessary. Especially in the case of smart cottages, many people buy them as a second home and are unlikely to be there every day. In this case, they may struggle to get information about the condition of the plants, unless they have restrictions except for gardening with Tiiun.\\
    \item[b.]Brown Thumb
    \item[] In abroad, the term, brown thumb, means the people who always kill the plant because of lack of skills. Like this, there are more things to worry about in growing plants than you think, so if you don't pay attention, you often kill the plants, and even if you care a lot, there are many cases where you kill the plants because you don't know how to grow them properly. Therefore, Software, to help all of the plant growers can grow them easily, is essential. \\
    \item[c.]Rasing Plants: absence of communication
    \item[] Although raising pet plants is already known to help with various emotional stability, it was judged that there was less of a feeling of communication with each other compared to animals with which one could actually communicate. In order to grow plants well, constant attention is needed, and for this to happen, it is important to have affection for the plants. Therefore, in order to increase the fun of growing plants, it is necessary to be able to communicate with plants. \\
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.]Meeting the needs of more customers
    \item[]Considering the aforementioned, the number of people interested in gardening, cottages, etc. will increase. To contribute to increasing the value of life for the growing number of caterers' customers who grow their own gardens in cottages, we have adopted LG Tiiun which can be used in the outside garden of LG Smart Cottage as a target appliance. \\
    \item[b.]Brown thumb turns into green thumb with LG
    \item[]We have designed a software that allows people who are not talented in plant care to easily grow plants. To briefly introduce the features, customers can register their plants with the app and it will adjust the appropriate temperature, humidity, light, ventilation, etc. according to the plant species and automatically spray water and nutrients. Through the camera, the current health status of the plant (pest infestation, wilting, etc.) can be identified using AI, so that the customer can come and check the plant before it dies. \\
    \item[c.]Build a bond with plants
    \item[]One of the disadvantages of growing plants is that customer can only get an idea of their condition by looking at the wilting of their leaves or the appearance of fruits or flowers, and can't communicate with them directly like animals. These disadvantages reduce the fun of growing plants. To overcome this, we devised a feature that allows customer to communicate with plants using generative AI. If customers can communicate with their plants, they will be able to build a bond with them and give them more affection. \\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Research on Any Relative Software}

Known for its sleek and intuitive user interface, MacOS offers a seamless development experience. It provides a wide range of powerful tools and frameworks, making it an excellent choice for building applications for various platforms. With MacOS, developers can take advantage of tools like Xcode, which is the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for Apple's platforms. This is especially important when the application we want to develop must also support IOS. To develop for iOS, Xcode is essential, and Xcode can only run on MacOS. Xcode offers a comprehensive set of tools and resources for developing iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications. Additionally, MacOS has a strong integration with other Apple products and services, allowing developers to create a cohesive ecosystem across different devices. Overall, MacOS provides a robust and efficient development environment for developers looking to create software for Apple. \\
    \end{enumerate}

    \item[b.]Tools and Language

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[1.]JavaScript(JS)
        \item[]JavaScript is a widely-used programming language known for its versatility and its ability to create dynamic and interactive web applications. It serves as the backbone of modern web development and is supported by all major web browsers. With JavaScript, developers can add functionality to websites, handle user interactions, and manipulate web page content. It is a high-level, interpreted language that allows for rapid development and prototyping. After the introduction of Google's V8 engine-based Node.js, JavaScript can now be executed in a non-browser environment as well. JavaScript also benefits from a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, which enhance its capabilities and simplify the development process. These libraries and frameworks are published by npm, the Node Package Manager, and developers can easily download and utilize them in their projects. Some notable features of JavaScript include its single-threaded nature, prototype-based language structure, and its status as a script language. JavaScript is regularly updated by ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association), with the updated version being referred to as ECMAScript. Recent ECMAScript versions support object-oriented programming and functional programming. In summary, JavaScript is an essential language for web development, empowering developers to create engaging and interactive user experiences on the web. \\

        \item[2.]TypeScript(TS) \cite{typescript}
        \item[]TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides static typing, making it a powerful tool for building robust and scalable applications. It was developed by Microsoft and first published to the public in 2012. With TypeScript, developers can catch errors during compile-time, resulting in fewer bugs and improved code quality. It offers advanced features such as interfaces, generics, and decorators, which enhance code organization and maintainability. TypeScript is fully compatible with JavaScript, allowing developers to gradually migrate their existing JavaScript codebases to TypeScript. It also seamlessly integrates with popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks, making it a versatile choice for web development. Nowadays, companies are compelled to adopt TypeScript instead of JavaScript, regardless of project size, due to its numerous benefits. Overall, TypeScript is a valuable addition to the development environment, offering enhanced type safety and productivity for developers.\\

        \item[3.]yarn \cite{yarn2016}
        \item[]Yarn is a JavaScript package manager that helps manage project package dependencies and facilitates package sharing among developers. Due to security and performance issues experienced with npm as their projects grew larger, Facebook developed Yarn as a replacement. Yarn offers improvements in performance and security compared to npm. One key advantage of Yarn is that it installs packages in parallel, unlike npm which installs them sequentially, resulting in faster installation times. Yarn also utilizes caching, further speeding up package installation. Additionally, Yarn utilizes semantic versioning to specify package versions. For this project, we have chosen to use Yarn due to its fast performance. This is especially important as we will be installing various frameworks and libraries for frontend development. \\

        \item[4.]Eslint/Prettier \cite{eslintprettier}
        \item[]ESLint performs automated scans of your JavaScript and TypeScript files to detect common syntax and style errors. Prettier scans your files for style issues and automatically reformats your code to ensure consistent rules for indentation, spacing, semicolons, and quotes (single vs double). We use these tools on our teams for the following reasons: \\
        \begin{itemize}
            \item They promote consistency by enforcing the same rules for everyone.
            \item They save time in code reviews by allowing us to focus on code structure and semantics instead of style issues.
            \item They catch errors, with ESLint being particularly effective at detecting syntax errors and basic type errors like undefined variables. Although Prettier doesn't catch errors, it still contributes to code quality.
            \item Changes made by these tools are automatically applied to code when the file is saved in Visual Studio Code.
        \end{itemize}
        While setting up these tools requires an initial time investment, the time-saving benefits accumulate over time.\\

        \item[5.]React-Native \cite{reactnative}
        \item[]React Native is an open-source UI software framework developed by Meta Platform, Inc. It enables developers to use the React framework along with native platform capabilities to build applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, and Windows. Unlike web apps, React Native communicates with the Native Thread through native bridges, resulting in optimized performance. In terms of hybrid frameworks, Flutter has an advantage in making it easier for web developers to write React Native code. Previously, there was a perception that Flutter was much faster and lighter. However, with the introduction of Fabric in React Native 0.68, which supports faster communication between Android and iOS, that perception has become a thing of the past. That being said, React Native does heavily rely on other libraries, even for core features like the camera function in mobile applications, which requires the use of third-party libraries. Nevertheless, due to the aforementioned advantages, it is difficult to find a better option than React Native for creating fast and cross-platform applications that support both Android and iOS.\\

        \item[6.]React Query \cite{tanstackquery}
        \item[]React Query is a library that simplifies the process of fetching, caching, and keeping your React application's server state synchronized and updated. Unlike other data fetching methods that require complex and verbose code, React Query provides a simple and intuitive API that can be used within React Components. Previously, managing state in React applications lacked clear distinction, leading to confusion when writing code. Specifically, determining which state should be continuously fetched from the network and which state is solely dependent on the client required a thorough understanding. However, with the introduction of React Query, you can easily differentiate between server state management and client state management in your React application. This distinction enables efficient collaboration and simplifies cache operations, loading operations, and the implementation of difficult asynchronous operations in network state management. \\

        \item[7.]Recoil \cite{recoiljs}
        \item[]In React, it can be challenging to directly pass data between two different components unless they have a parent-child relationship. In such cases, you need to send the data to the parent component and then pass it back to the component that requires it. This process, known as props drilling, can make it difficult to keep track of the props being passed around. That's why having a global state management library is crucial for modern React applications. React's own Context API requires implementing it from scratch and requires significant effort to prevent unnecessary re-rendering. On the other hand, Redux, which was the most popular choice until 2020, has a steep learning curve and a complex architecture that can make it challenging to understand the code flow quickly. In contrast, Recoil is relatively easy to use if you understand the basic syntax of React. It is also free from re-rendering issues and provides various optional features for global state management. Additionally, Recoil is lightweight and does not significantly impact application performance.\\

        \item[8.]Python \cite{gabialibrary}
        \item[]Developed in 1991 by programmer Guido van Rossum, Python is known for its readability and easy syntax, making it quicker to learn compared to other programming languages. As a result, it has gained popularity among non-programmers and is utilized in various fields such as statistics, data analysis, modeling, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. Python's intuitive and user-friendly syntax makes it highly recommended for beginners in programming. Additionally, it is the most widely adopted language, meaning that many libraries necessary for application development are readily available. Therefore, we have chosen Python for building the backend and training machine learning models.\\

        \item[9.]Django \cite{djangogirlstutorial}
        \item[]Django is a popular and widely used web application framework written in Python. It offers robust features and components for efficient website and web application development. One of its key advantages is simplifying and accelerating the development process. Django provides pre-built components for user authentication, an admin panel, forms, and file uploads. User authentication is made simple with a few lines of code, ensuring secure sign up, log in, and log out. The admin panel allows easy content and data management. Django's form handling system simplifies the implementation of complex forms with validation and error handling. Handling file uploads is effortless with Django's built-in capabilities. Additionally, Django has a vast ecosystem of libraries and extensions, such as djangorestframework for creating RESTful APIs. Overall, Django is a versatile and powerful framework for building robust and scalable web applications, suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.\\


        \item[10.]SQlite \cite{velog-django-tutorial}
        \item[]Since SQLite doesn't run as a server process, it's a ready-to-use database. It's lightweight but has all the necessary features. It supports transactions and is platform-agnostic. Since it's a locally run DB, it's also highly portable. However, it is not an isolated environment, so the server must also handle the burden of the DB. Additionally, you can't authorize users, only assign basic access rights based on the operating system. We decided to use SQLite because it is supported by Django and our application doesn't have a complex database structure or require various features of a database management system.\\

        \item[11.]AWS EC2 \cite{aws-ec2-docs}
        \item[]Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers scalable computing capacity on-demand in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. By using Amazon EC2, you can accelerate application development and deployment while reducing hardware costs. Instead of purchasing physical servers, our team has decided to utilize a cloud system for its economic benefits and flexibility for future expansion. With Amazon EC2, you can deploy multiple virtual servers, configure security and networking, and manage storage. It allows you to increase capacity (scale up) to handle compute-intensive tasks such as monthly or annual processes or spikes in website traffic. Conversely, when usage decreases, you can decrease capacity (scale down). One of the great advantages of Amazon EC2 is that it is free for the first year. Since our application needs to be built urgently and will not run for more than a year, Amazon EC2 is an excellent choice.\\

        \item[12.]Jupyter NoteBook \cite{wikidocs-tutorial}
        \item[]Jupyter Notebook is a popular open-source web application that provides an interactive environment for writing code, visualizing data, and documenting. It supports various programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia. Jupyter Notebook is organized into code cells and markdown cells. In code cells, you can write and run Python code, while in markdown cells, you can write documents, formulas, or insert images. This combination of code and documentation is especially useful for projects like data analytics and machine learning. One of the advantages of Jupyter Notebook is the ability to run Python code line by line and view the results, which is helpful for debugging and testing. The output is immediately displayed below the code, allowing you to see visualized graphs, tables, and more. Additionally, Jupyter Notebook can be easily used online. Google Colab, provided by Google, is a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment. For our project, we will utilize Jupyter Notebook to run machine learning tasks using Python. Machine learning often involves writing lengthy code, and it is crucial to check and debug the results along the way. Jupyter Notebook is the ideal tool for this purpose.\\

        \item[13.]Tensorflow / Tensorflow light \cite{oracle-tensorflow}
        \item[]TensorFlow is a library created by Google that provides features for implementing deep learning programs. It is primarily implemented in C++, but supports multiple languages including Python, Java, and Go. However, Python is prioritized as it is most suitable for our application. Machine learning is a complex field, but with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, implementing a machine learning model has become more accessible and less complicated. These frameworks simplify tasks such as data acquisition, model training, making predictions, and refining results. Additionally, TensorFlow Lite is a mobile library designed for deploying models on mobile devices, microcontrollers, and other edge devices. When running a machine learning or deep learning model through TensorFlow Lite, it produces a small file of less than 3MB. This allows us to use trained models on mobile without any capacity constraints. In our application, we will use TensorFlow Lite to ensure immediate model availability on mobile devices.\\


        \item[14.]Material Design \cite{google-material-design}
        \item[]UI/UX is crucial in modern mobile and web applications, and a unified UI can greatly enhance the user experience. This unified UI is achieved through the use of a design system. However, implementing a design system on your own can be challenging. Therefore, it is common practice to utilize publicly available design systems, with Google's Material Design being the most prominent one. Material Design is a design approach that combines the benefits of flat design with the use of shadows to create a sense of depth. It also provides a comprehensive design system that includes typography and primary-secondary color schemes. This design can be easily implemented in the Figma library and seamlessly integrated into code using react-native-paper. \\

        \item[15.]Git \cite{velog-git}
        \item[]Git is an effective version control system that allows you to manage versions and incorporate changes and updates seamlessly. But before delving into Git, let`s first discuss what a ``version control system'' is. It is a system that records changes to a file over time and enables you to retrieve that file later when needed. When working on a document, there are usually multiple revisions and updates from the initial draft to the final version. Along the way, we often rename the file to ``final,'' ``\_final,'' ``finalized,'' and so on, thus overwriting the previous versions. This can make it difficult to go back to a specific point in time and understand the changes that were made. However, with a version control system, this becomes possible. By using a version control system, you can manage multiple versions of the same information. This allows you to track changes over time and identify the individuals who made them. You can easily revert back to previous versions or the original version, and quickly identify the person responsible for any issues that may arise.\\

        \item[16.]Cloudinary 
        \item[]Cloudinary is a cloud-based media management platform that enables you to efficiently manage, optimize, and distribute images and videos. This service is particularly useful for effectively managing and optimizing the media assets used in your web and mobile applications. While AWS's image server could have been an option, we considered the fact that our machine learning models run within Django. Using AWS's static server would have compromised server capacity and performance. Therefore, we made the decision to utilize Cloudinary as a completely new static server for images. Now, the AWS server only needs to store the image download addresses from Cloudinary in its database.\\

The Plant List Page, which appears immediately after a user logs in, displays a list of plants currently growing in Tiiun on SmartCottage or those previously grown and successfully harvested. The plant list is retrieved from the server via a GET request. This page, found on the first tab, is one of three screens where the bottom tab bar is visible. The icon on the first tab should be in the primary color, with the other two icons in the disabled color. The page should be titled "Plant List" at the top. Below that, there are two top tabs: 'Growing' and 'Harvested'.\\

\textbf{For the "Growing" Tab}: (1) If no plants are currently growing, an 'Add Plant' button should be displayed in the center of the screen, accompanied by a text prompt to add a plant. Clicking the 'Add Plant' button will navigate to the 'Plant Add Page'. (2) If plants are growing, the screen should display a scrollable list of plants, each presented as a card. These cards contain six elements: a plant picture, a nickname, the number of days spent with the plant, a growth stage guide, a 'Chat with Plant' button, and a 'Plant Details' button. Clicking on a plant card navigates to the 'Plant Detail Page'. The 'Chat with Plant' button opens the chat feature, while the 'Plant Details' button leads to the 'Plant Detail Page'. A floating button at the bottom of the scroll directs to the 'Plant Add Page' when clicked. (3) If the maximum number of plants has been reached, a message should appear stating that no more plants can be added. This message may be overlooked if the list of plants is full, requiring the user to scroll to see the bottom. If the 'Add Plant' floating button is clicked in this case, the button should change to a disabled color and a toast message should display, indicating that adding more plants is not permitted.\\

    \end{figure}
    
\textbf{For the "Completed" Tab:}
    (1) If you don't currently have any harvested plants, write a text in the center of the screen stating that you don't have any harvested plants and encouraging you to grow your plants to harvest them. (2) If you do have any harvested plants, the body of the screen should be a scrolling page. Within the scrolling screen, show a list of harvested plants in card format, one by one. Nothing happens when the plant card button is pressed. Inside the plant card, there are three pieces of information: a picture of the plant, the plant's nickname, and the date it was grown.


\subsection{Community Page}

    \end{figure}
The Community Page is a resource for BloomMate users. It provides answers to questions, solutions to problems, and necessary information. The aim is to reduce user bounce rates and enhance farming experiences with accurate information from smartCottage. Plant list items are fetched from the server using GET requests. The bottom tab bar, one of three screens displayed, is located on the first tab. Icons on the second tab should be in the primary color, while the remaining two icons should be in the disabled color. The Community Page should feature the title 'Plant Buttler Community' at the top. Directly underneath, there should be two main tabs: 'Questions and Answers' and 'Expert Articles'.\\

\textbf{For the "Questions and Answers" Tab: } The main part of the Q\&A screen is a scrolling page, with questions displayed in a card format, sorted by the most recently asked. Tapping on a question card directs you to the Question Detail Page. Each question card includes four details: answer completeness, question date, question title, and question body. The question body has an 80-character limit; if it exceeds this, it's truncated with ellipses. At the bottom of the scroll screen, there's a floating button. Pressing this button navigates to the Add Question page.\\

\textbf{For the "Expert Articles" Tab:} The article screen should be a scrollable page where articles are displayed in a card format. Each card contains two pieces of information: a thumbnail image and a title. Tapping on an article will allow you to view it in WebView.

\subsection{Question Add Page}

    \caption{Question Add Page}
    \end{figure}
    
The Question Add Page is where users can post their inquiries. Users can ask about their BloomMate experience, report issues, or pose questions about their plants. Each question includes a title and content, both provided by the user as TextInput. However, the content is entered in a multiline TextInput. Each TextInput features an appropriate placeholder. The Ask Question button is located at the bottom. Initially disabled, it becomes enabled when both title and content contain at least one character. An arrow icon on the top left of the page serves as a back button, leading back to the Community Page.

\subsection{Question Detail Page}

    \end{figure}
 MyPage, a feature of BloomMate, provides information tailored to the user. It is found on the third tab of the bottom bar, which is visible on three screens. The icon on the second tab should be in the primary color, while the other two icons should be in the disabled color. At the top, MyPage should be titled 'MyPage', followed by a welcome message in the form '\textit{Welcome userName}'. MyPage offers three functions: Logout, View Membership, and About BloomMate.\\

The Logout function, when clicked, deletes the user's cookie information and redirects the user to the landing page.\\

The View Membership function, upon selection, navigates the user to a new screen where they can review their membership details. This screen displays five types of information: name, ID, activated product key, garden size, and address.\\

Lastly, the About BloomMate function directs the user to a Notion webview that provides an introduction to BloomMate.\\

\subsection{Plant Add Page}
BloomMate is an app designed to assist you in growing plants in Tiiun. To use it, you need to register your plants on the Plant Add Page. The plant addition process requires input in four fields: photo, variety, nickname, and planting date. Each field is located on a separate page, with the photo field split across two additional pages. All fields are mandatory and cannot be skipped. All pages feature an arrow icon in the top left corner, indicating a return function. Clicking this icon will either take you back to the Plant List Page if you're at the first step, or to the previous step. Each page also includes a Call-To-Action (CTA) button at the bottom. This button will only be activated once all fields on the page are filled out correctly. The button text reads "Add Plant" on the final step and "Continue" on all other pages. On the final step, pressing the activated Register button will trigger a server request to the Add Plant Post API. Upon successful receipt, you will be redirected to the Login Page.
    \begin{figure}[h]

    }
    \label{fig}
    \caption{Plant Add Page: add Picture}
    \end{figure}

Now let's explain each input: (1) For photos, once the user takes a photo, it is instantly registered with the photo server using a POST request. The URL received from the photo server is then used in the final POST request. (2) Regarding plant varieties, users can choose one of the four options provided in the bottom-sheet via a toggle button. The options are strawberry, tomato, potato, and corn. These varieties are used in the AI model. They were chosen for their suitability in home gardens due to their reasonable growth heights. The toggle button allows you to switch between varieties. If another variety is selected while one is already active, the first one will be deselected. (3) For nicknames, the user should enter a minimum of 1 character and a maximum of 5 characters. TextInput allows direct input from the user through the keyboard. (4) To choose the planting date, users can select a date from the calendar provided in the bottom-sheet. Dates later than the present are not selectable. The selected and pressed states should be clearly marked.

    \subsection{Plant Detail Page}
    \begin{figure}[h]

    \label{fig}
    \caption{Plant Detail Page}
    \end{figure}
Users want to access information about the plants they are growing. To fulfill this need, they should be able to view plant details on the Plant Detail Page. All plant details are obtained from the server through a GET request. Plant information can be categorized into two types: details and growth information. Details remain the same for each plant variety. The Plant Detail Page displays eight types of details: variety, temperature, humidity, light level, flowering time, watering frequency, difficulty, and precautions. The growth information indicates the current stage of the plant based on the planting date: germination, growing, or harvesting. We have included a graph to provide a quick overview of the growth information. At the bottom of the page, there are buttons for different scenarios: a 'Harvest' button during the harvest season and a 'Diagnose' button for other situations. Clicking the Harvest button triggers a PATCH request to the server and redirects you to the Plant List Page. On the Plant List Page, the plant is no longer considered a growing plant as it has been harvested. Alternatively, you can click the Diagnose button, which will take you to a page where you can diagnose the plant. In the top-right corner, there is a button that navigates to the Plant Edit Page. The top-left corner of the page contains a left arrow icon. Clicking the arrow icon will return you to the Plant List Page.

    \subsection{Plant Edit Page}
    \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.3\columnwidth]{HYU-SE-2023-BloomMate-DOCUMENT/img/Plant Details - Edit.png}
    \label{fig}
    \caption{Plant Edit Page}
    \end{figure}

    Users may want to update information about their plants, especially if they're growing them and need to take pictures of them frequently as they grow. The Plant Edit Page is designed for this purpose. There are two things that can be updated: a nickname and a photo. The nickname is accepted as a TextInput, and if it is empty, an error will be thrown. The photo can be updated by taking a picture. At the bottom is the Update button, which is activated if at least one item exists that is different from the existing one and there are no errors. If you press an active update button, it will send a PATCH request to the server, and if it is successful, you will be taken to the Plant Detail Page. In the top left corner of the page, you will see an arrow icon indicating left. Pressing the arrow icon will take you back to the Plant Detail Page.
    

    \subsection{Plant Diagnosis}
    \begin{figure}[h]
    \centerline{
        \includegraphics[width=.3\columnwidth]{HYU-SE-2023-BloomMate-DOCUMENT/img/Diagnose - notice.png}

    }
    \label{fig}
    \caption{Plant Diagnosis}
    \end{figure}
One of BloomMate's main features is AI plant diagnostics, which serves two purposes. Firstly, it helps users, especially those with limited plant-growing experience, determine if their plants have any diseases by diagnosing their health. The AI diagnosis simplifies the decision-making process. Secondly, by encouraging users to regularly diagnose their plants when visiting SmartCottage, it promotes a sense of care and nurtures a loving relationship between users and their plants.

The plant diagnosis process begins on the information page, where users can learn about the benefits of using AI to diagnose their plants. It also reminds them to periodically visit SmartCottage to monitor their plants. From the information page, users can navigate to the Make a Diagnosis page and the Diagnosis History page.\\

The Make a Diagnosis page functions as a camera app. Users take a picture of their plant using the app, and the diagnosis is performed within their phone using the TensorFlow Lite model. After the diagnosis is complete, users are directed to the diagnosis results page. The diagnosis result will indicate whether the plant is (1) sick or (2) healthy. For each diagnosis, the following information is provided: the photo taken, the date of diagnosis, and the plant's growth stage (germination/growing). If the plant is diagnosed as sick, users will receive guidance on the disease, symptoms, and conditions. Unfortunately, if the plant is diseased, it will need to be replanted. Additionally, the generative AI will automatically provide a link to purchase customized Tiiun seeds that are most suitable for the user's current plant. By tapping on the link, users can make the purchase, and a confirmation message will be displayed. At the bottom of the page, there are options to reshoot the picture or return to the diagnosis guide page.\\

The Diagnostic History page displays a scrolling screen where users can view their previous diagnosis records. Each diagnosis history is presented in a card format, showing the photo taken, the date of diagnosis, and the plant's growth stage. By tapping on a diagnosis history card, users can view the diagnosis log page in the same format as the diagnosis results page.

\subsection{Chat With Plant}
    \begin{figure}[h]
    \centerline{
        \includegraphics[width=.3\columnwidth]{HYU-SE-2023-BloomMate-DOCUMENT/img/Chat.png}
        \includegraphics[width=.3\columnwidth]{HYU-SE-2023-BloomMate-DOCUMENT/img/Chat - today.png}

    }
    \label{fig}
    \caption{Chat With Plant}
    \end{figure}

    The chat feature is the second core component of BloomMate. Each day, when a user requests to start a chat, the server synthesizes all available information and generates a script to send to the generative AI. This script essentially prompts the generative AI to assume the role of a plant. The server utilizes six types of information to create the script: plant details, plant nickname, plant planting date, today's weather, Tiiun soil information, and diagnostic information. Today's weather is obtained from the weather API based on the address provided during the signup process. As for Tiiun soil information, it is currently not accessible, so we will randomly generate a good or bad status. Regarding diagnostic information, we only retrieve the date of the last diagnosis, not the actual content. We assume that this date represents the last time the user visited SmartCottage. If it has been more than a week, we will include a situation in the script where the plant expresses a desire to see the user.\\
\\Let's recap the chat flow with the plant:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[1.]The user clicks the "Start today's chat" button.
    \item[2.]The server generates a script to obtain today's report from the generative AI and sends it to the client.
    \item[3.]The client checks the report and, if the soil condition is bad, generates a link for fertilizer recommendations from the generative AI.
    \item[4.]The user is then free to chat with the generative AI, which has been trained with scripts.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Additional specifications:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[1.]The above flow applies when there are no ongoing chats for the day. If there is already an active chat, users can continue without the need for the "Start" button.
    \item[2.]Today's chat ends at midnight every day.
    \item[3.]There is a floating button located at the bottom left of the screen. Tapping on the previous report will open a bottom-sheet with a calendar. By selecting a past date from the calendar, users can view the chat history for that specific day.
