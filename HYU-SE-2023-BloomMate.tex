\section{Introduction}
\subsection{motivation}
a. Customer Trend Analysis
\begin{enumerate}
    \item positive effect of pet plant
    \item[] Pet plant is known for positive effect to give psychological/emotional stability and inspiration about life satisfaction. Especially, it is showing clear tangible results in several areas like overcome stress and depression, therapy various physical illnesses, air purification. \cite{ju2020} \\
    
    \item The appearance of Green Hobby
    \item[] As interest in planterior increases, sales of flower gardens/flowers increased compared to the previous year (2019). The search volume of 'planterior' on Naver, a search portal site, also increased significantly during the pandemic compared to pre-COVID-19, especially during the April 2020 pandemic. Also, attention in urban farmer, self-gardening, weekend farm is growth. An indicator that can confirm this is the number of Instagram hashtag posts, with the home gardening tag exceeding 520,000 and the planterior tag exceeding 163,000. \cite{hanaif_report} \\
    
    \item Impact of COVID-19
    \item[] Pet plant has long received attention to relieve loneliness in single-person households or the elderly, and the home gardening market, including pet plant, has grown rapidly as restrictions have arisen on outdoor activities since the COVID-19.
Compared to before COVID-19, sales of flowerpots increased by 20\%, gardening supplies increased by 48\%, and seedlings increased by 92\%. March to April 2020, SSG.com saw a 97\% increase in home gardening category sales, and Enuri.com saw a 491\% increase in garden set sales.
Accordingly, the Rural Development Administration predicted that domestic home gardening sales will increase rapidly after COVID-19, reaching 500 billion won in 2023, an eight-fold increase from 60 billion won in 2020. \cite{ajunews_article} \\

\item Expanding the market size of plant cultivation machines
\item[] The market for plant growers that allow you to grow flowers and vegetables at home becomes larger. The market size, which was 10 billion won in 2019, increased to 60 billion won in 2020 and is expected to reach 500 billion won in 2023. \cite{spcmagazine_article}
\\

\item Urban agriculture
\item[] The number of 'urban farmers' in Seoul, who farm on rooftops, verandas, and weekend farms, increased 14-fold from 45,000 in 2011 to 640,000 in 2019. During the same period, Seoul's urban agricultural space also increased 6.9 times from 29ha to 202ha. \cite{hani_article} \\

\item Desired residential space after retirement
\item[] In 2021, the real estate platform 'Zigbang' conducted a survey on the residential space desired after retirement, and 'country house, townhouse' ranked first with 38\%, beating apartments (35.4\%). When comparing housing transactions in the first half of the year by housing type, apartment transactions decreased in June compared to January, while house transactions increased.  \cite{donga_article}\\

\item[]Considering these data, interest in horticulture such as home gardening and planterior is steadily increasing, and along with this, interest in weekend farms, vacation homes, country houses, etc. is also steadily growth. Therefore, it can be expected that the demand for gardening or growing plants in country houses will gradually get larger. At the same time, sales of plant-related home appliances will also become greater. \\
\end{enumerate}


%Company Analysis

\indent b. Company Analysis
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Regulations related to the companion plant industry
    \item[] As interest in pet plants grew, the Seoul Metropolitan Council passed the ‘Ordinance on Fostering and Supporting the Pet Plant Industry’ at the plenary session in May, laying the foundation for the growth of the pet plant industry and focusing on expanding supporting projects.\cite{mediapen_article} \\
    
    \item LG Electronics: Innovation for a Better Life 
    \item[] LG Electronics is currently trying to change from being a company that only sells simple home appliances to a company that provides a lifestyle that can change customers' lives to be smarter through applications such as ThinQ.
    \begin{figure}[h]

\label{fig:brand}
\caption{LG electronics Brand Goal} 
\end{figure}
\\
Customers are always at the center of the LG brand story. LG makes an incredible contribution to the lives of its customers and always strives to make their lives more valuable.\\
\\
\indent i. PEOPLE\\
Just as important as a good product is the customer experience using that product. Customers' lives are improved with new products through creativity and innovation, and a richer life is completed by experiencing products with excellent aesthetic satisfaction. Every product we create must be able to play that role in our customers’ lives. Creating a better life is how we do our best for our customers.\\

ii. SINCERITY \\
How to make life new and more convenient, our technology always starts with sincerity toward customers and their lives. It is an attitude of constantly making passionate efforts and pursuing sophistication through thorough perfection rather than flashiness, and the most important factor when creating products is sincerity.\\

iii. BASICS \\
Rather than being different for the sake of being different or flashy for show, we focus on the core values that customers who use the product expect. The core value refers to offering important value to customers' lives beyond the product's functions. \cite{lge_document}

\end{enumerate}

\indent c. Product Analysis
\begin{enumerate}
\item LG Smart Cottage
\item[] It is a small modular house in the form of a second house that combines LG Electronics' advanced energy, heating, and cooling technology, and differentiated premium home appliances, with a two-story one-room structure measuring 31.4m$^2$.
The 4kW solar panel installed on the roof can cover a significant amount of the electricity used per day by two adults, and the heat pump cooling and heating system 'Therma V Monobloc' is installed to significantly reduce energy consumption. A home energy solution was implemented that stores used power in a home ESS system. There is a charger for electric vehicles (EV) outside the Smart Cottage, and the inside is equipped with premium home appliances equipped with various technologies to increase energy efficiency, such as the Objet Collection Wash Tower Compact, a dishwasher, an induction electric range, and a water purifier. Through the ‘LG ThinQ’ application, you can check home appliances, heating, cooling, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and energy storage and consumption. It has a premium interior with a warm atmosphere, with a sophisticated design based on the concept of walnut wood tone and an exterior finished in light beige. \\

\item LG Tiiun
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{HYU-SE-2023-BloomMate-DOCUMENT/tiiun.png}
\label{fig:tiiun}
\caption{LG Tiiun} 
\end{figure}
\item[] LG Tiiun is a home plant grower designed to target the home gardening market, which is expanding due to the impact of COVID-19. It can be said to be the culmination of LG's technologies, combining the temperature control technology of the Dios refrigerator, the air conditioning technology of the Whisen air conditioner, the inverter compressor technology of the Tromm dryer, the water supply control technology of the PuriCare water purifier, and the LED lights of LG Display. You can easily and comfortably grow plants by filling them with water 6 times and adding nutrients 6 times in a month. The power consumption for one year is 42.5kWh, which is similar to that of a small refrigerator. LG Tiiun consists of two shelves (upper and lower compartments), and a total of six seed kits can be installed, three each. Seed kits limited to 2 types of herbs, 4 types of leafy vegetables, and 1 type of flower are being sold. Through the LG ThinQ app, you can check the operation/growing status on your smartphone and receive a notification when nutrients or water are insufficient. \\

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.]LG Smart Cottage: absence of home turf
    \item[] People live in house almost enjoy gardening. However, LG Smart Cottage that LG Electronics launched doesn’t have home turf. So, we think LG Tiiun for outside to help with LG’s brand goal is necessary. Especially in the case of smart cottages, many people buy them as a second home and are unlikely to be there every day. In this case, they may struggle to get information about the condition of the plants, unless they have restrictions except for gardening with Tiiun.\\
    \item[b.]Brown Thumb
    \item[] In abroad, the term, brown thumb, means the people who always kill the plant because of lack of skills. Like this, there are more things to worry about in growing plants than you think, so if you don't pay attention, you often kill the plants, and even if you care a lot, there are many cases where you kill the plants because you don't know how to grow them properly. Therefore, Software, to help all of the plant growers can grow them easily, is essential. \\
    \item[c.]Rasing Plants: absence of communication
    \item[] Although raising pet plants is already known to help with various emotional stability, it was judged that there was less of a feeling of communication with each other compared to animals with which one could actually communicate. In order to grow plants well, constant attention is needed, and for this to happen, it is important to have affection for the plants. Therefore, in order to increase the fun of growing plants, it is necessary to be able to communicate with plants. \\
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.]Meeting the needs of more customers
    \item[]Considering the aforementioned, the number of people interested in gardening, cottages, etc. will increase. To contribute to increasing the value of life for the growing number of caterers' customers who grow their own gardens in cottages, we have adopted LG Tiiun which can be used in the outside garden of LG Smart Cottage as a target appliance. \\
    \item[b.]Brown thumb turns into green thumb with LG
    \item[]We have designed a software that allows people who are not talented in plant care to easily grow plants. To briefly introduce the features, customers can register their plants with the app and it will adjust the appropriate temperature, humidity, light, ventilation, etc. according to the plant species and automatically spray water and nutrients. Through the camera, the current health status of the plant (pest infestation, wilting, etc.) can be identified using AI, so that the customer can come and check the plant before it dies. \\
    \item[c.]Build a bond with plants
    \item[]One of the disadvantages of growing plants is that customer can only get an idea of their condition by looking at the wilting of their leaves or the appearance of fruits or flowers, and can't communicate with them directly like animals. These disadvantages reduce the fun of growing plants. To overcome this, we devised a feature that allows customer to communicate with plants using generative AI. If customers can communicate with their plants, they will be able to build a bond with them and give them more affection. \\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Research on Any Relative Software}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a.]Groo
